The treatment uses plasma pen technology to shrink the surface area of the skin. The treatment is delivered using an electronic handpiece (FDA cleared equipment) containing a small metal probe, that when exposed to atmospheric gas (nitrogen) produces a tiny plasma flash between the device tip and the skin. This creates micro injuries on the skin. These tiny superficial traumas result in the skin tightening and lifting. During the process the skin’s pores open and the superfluous plasma or water evaporates. The excess skin dies down superficially and falls off in the form of dandruff during the natural healing process.<br><br>The results are immediately noticeable just after one treatment and the results increase over the following 90 days where the elasticity of the skin and the skin tightening effects continue to progress due to the healing of the dermis promoting the production of collagen and elastin which produces long lasting results.The device needle is a single-patient use, so always is a sterile needle. The needle does not penetrate the skin at any point!</p></div></div></section> <section class="accordion-item"> <div class="accordion-item-header"> <h2>Why Choose Fibroblast?</h2> </div><div class="accordion-item-body"> <div class="accordion-item-body-content"> <p>Plasma Fibroblast is a non-surgical treatment that can be applied to areas that other treatments might not be able to target as effectively, Plasma Fibroblast delivers results with the advantage of minimal downtime and low risk of infection. For example, this treatment allows you to treat areas such as eyelids that generally can’t be treated with other modalities (e.g — laser, RF or IPL).<br><br>Results from Fibroblast treatments are also faster and more significant than those that can be achieved by microneedling and laser alone; results can be seen for up to 18-24 months with as little as two or three treatments, and minimal maintenance is required.<br><br><br>Fibroblast skin treatments have a tightening effect on skin that has lost its firmness, with immediate visible results that last as they would with surgical options – for just a fraction of the cost!<br>Due to this treatment being applied as a spot treatment, downtime for a client is just 5 – 10 days (as opposed to the months of recovery required after surgery), and there’s low risk of infections and scarring if the thorough aftercare regime is followed.Fibroblast skin treatments can be performed on the face, neck, hands and most parts of the body, and offers more than just face lifts and includes:</p><ul> <li>Skin tag removal</li><li>Lip Flips (very popular)</li><li>Wrinkle reduction</li><li>Forehead lines reduction</li><li>Scar reduction</li><li>Double chin tightening</li><li>Eye lift (crows feet, under &amp; upper eye lift)</li></ul> <p>Plasma treatment can be slightly uncomfortable but definitely bareable, however a numbing cream can be applied for extra comfort. A tightening effect can be seen immediately after treatment. There will be mild swelling of the treated area for a few days and small dots will form, these remain for about 5-10 days and then will naturally shed.</p></div></div></section> <section class="accordion-item"> <div class="accordion-item-header"> <h2>How Many Treatments do I Need?</h2> </div><div class="accordion-item-body"> <div class="accordion-item-body-content"> <p>This will depend on several factors, factoring in depth of lines, treatment area, age, and the health of the client. On average 2-4 treatments are required per area however some just require the one treatment. You will see a great result even after 1 treatment however for the elevated longevity of the treatment minimum 2 sessions are recommended.</p></div></div></section> <section class="accordion-item"> <div class="accordion-item-header"> <h2>How Long Will the Treatment last?</h2> </div><div class="accordion-item-body"> <div class="accordion-item-body-content"> <p>On average for 2-4 years, however as everybody continues to age and even though collagen lasts a few years, the continuous ageing process will mean maintenance sessions will be required.</p></div></div></section> <section class="accordion-item"> <div class="accordion-item-header"> <h2>Preparing for Plasma Lift</h2> </div><div class="accordion-item-body"> <div class="accordion-item-body-content"> <p>We recommend you avoid sun-tanning, spray-tanning, tanning injections and sun-beds for 4 to 6 weeks before your treatment.<br><br>Ideally, we recommend using SPF50 to prep your skin for 2 to 4 weeks before your treatment, especially if you are naturally darker skinned. You may even wish to consider a pre-treatment product using a Tyrosinase Inhibitor as this can help prevent the enzyme “Tyrosinase” from misfiring or over-oxidising the Tyrosine and thus helps ensure there is no overproduction of pigment in the skin. Tyrosinase Inhibitors are not just useful for those who suffer from hyperpigmentation but for all clients – even those with healthy, even skin.<br><br>Avoid any other type of procedures for 3-4 weeks on the same area which you intend to have treated with fibroblast, such as:</p><ul> <li>laser therapy</li><li>chemical peels</li><li>botox/fillers</li><li>micro-needling</li></ul> <p>as this may prevent your treatment being performed by your technician at the time you want it. Discontinue any use of topical Retin-A products a minimum of 4 days prior to treatment.Remove contact lenses and any eyelash extensions prior to treatment</p></div></div></section> <section class="accordion-item"> <div class="accordion-item-header"> <h2>Who Is Not Suitable for This Treatment?</h2> </div><div class="accordion-item-body"> <div class="accordion-item-body-content"> <ul> <li>Those who have a dark complexion, as they are at higher risk for hyperpigmentation.</li><li>Anyone with Keloid Scarring.</li><li>Anyone under the age of 18.</li><li>People who are not able to adhere to the aftercare procedures and failure to follow the methods outlined and explained by the therapist can lead to infection.</li><li>Those with active skin disease including inflammation, dermatitis or rosacea flares, or any other skin disease where the barrier is impaired.</li><li>Anyone currently using a pacemaker.</li><li>Patients with an active cold sore (ie herpes simplex).
